# Employee Tracker

## Description: The Project

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
* Design the following database schema containing three tables: Employee, Role, Department.
* Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:
* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles
* Update employee managers
* View employees by manager
* Delete departments, roles, and employees
* View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.
Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.
Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
